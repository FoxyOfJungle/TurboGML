===================[ v3.0 ]===================

[FIXED] ds_debug_print() saying data structure doesn't exists even if it exists.
[FIXED] Improved draw_debug_resolutions() function.
[FIXED] Improved array_min, array_max and array_median.
[FIXED] Improved performance of array_contains_value().
[FIXED] DirectoryScanner returning files as -1 in some situations with different settings.
[FIXED] Small fix in display_get_inches(), it now works correctly.
[FIXED] Example improved.
[FIXED] Small fixes.

[CHANGED] DirectoryScanner constructor is now a function called directory_get_contents(), so TurboGML is free of constructors now.

[CHANGED] Renamed array_empty() function to array_is_empty().
[CHANGED] Renamed random_pseudo_numbers() to random_pseudo_numbers().

[REMOVED] All 3D-related functions (model_build_cube, model_build_plane, vertex_add_point...)
[REMOVED] draw_debug_slider(), because GameMaker added dbg_* functions. Use them instead.
[REMOVED] draw_debug_button(), because GameMaker added dbg_* functions. Use them instead.
[REMOVED] Delta time functions (there are better alternatives, please use them).
[REMOVED] All assert sunctions (there are better alternatives, please use them).
[REMOVED] generate_code() function. This function is not very useful and too generic, better do it yourself.
