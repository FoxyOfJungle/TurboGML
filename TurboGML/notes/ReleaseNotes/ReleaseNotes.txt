[FIXED] ClampedMagnitude() from Vector2 and Vector3 was giving an error.

[CHANGED] SORT_ASCENDING and SORT_DESCENDING optimized.

[CHANGED] array_empty() function renamed to array_is_empty().
[CHANGED] array_choose() function renamed to array_get_random().
[CHANGED] array_random_index() function renamed to array_get_random_index().

[CHANGED] Improved draw_debug_resolutions() function.
[CHANGED] It is now possible to initialize Vector2 and Vector3 as 0, without having to declare the number explicitly.

[REMOVED] wave_normalized(), as this function is a bit inconsistent and not very useful. Use wave_period() instead, or sin() directly.
[REMOVED] texturegroup_debug_draw_sprites(). Use the debug window with show_debug_overlay().

[REMOVED] All 3D-related functions (model_build_cube, model_build_plane, vertex_add_point...)
[REMOVED] draw_debug_slider(), because GameMaker added dbg_* functions. Use them instead.
[REMOVED] draw_debug_button(), because GameMaker added dbg_* functions. Use them instead.
[REMOVED] Delta time functions (there are better alternatives, please use them).
[REMOVED] All assert sunctions (there are better alternatives, please use them).
[REMOVED] generate_code() function. This function is not very useful and too generic, better do it yourself.
